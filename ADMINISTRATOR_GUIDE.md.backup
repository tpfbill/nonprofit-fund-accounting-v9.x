## 3. Installation Procedures

### 3.1. Traditional Linux Server
This is a summary of the full deployment process.

1.  **Connect & Update**: `ssh user@your-server-ip` then `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`.
2.  **Create App User**: `sudo adduser npfa` and `sudo usermod -aG sudo npfa`. Switch to user with `sudo su - npfa`.
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   **Node.js**: Use `nodesource` to install v18.
    *   **PostgreSQL**: `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`.
    *   **Nginx**: `sudo apt install nginx`.
4.  **Clone Repository**: `git clone -b v8.5 https://github.com/tpfbill/nonprofit-fund-accounting.git` into `/home/npfa/`.
5.  **Install App Dependencies**: `cd nonprofit-fund-accounting && npm install`.
6.  **Configure Environment**: Create a `.env` file with your database credentials and `NODE_ENV=production`.
7.  **Set up Database**: Create the user and database in PostgreSQL.
8.  **Initialize Database**: Run the SQL scripts from within the app directory:
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db -f src/db/db-init.sql
    psql -h localhost -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db -f add_top_level_organization.sql
    node add-test-data.js
    ```
9.  **Create Systemd Service**: Create `/etc/systemd/system/npfa.service` to run the app as a service.
10. **Configure Nginx**: Set up a reverse proxy in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` to forward requests to the Node.js app on port 3000.
11. **Enable Firewall & SSL**: Use `ufw` and `certbot` to secure the server.

### 3.2. Docker Deployment (Windows/Linux)
For detailed instructions, refer to **`DOCKER_SETUP_WINDOWS.md`**. The process is:

1.  **Clone Repository**: `git clone -b v8.5 https://github.com/tpfbill/nonprofit-fund-accounting.git`.
2.  **Configure Environment**: Rename `.env.docker` to `.env`.
3.  **Build & Run**: `docker-compose up -d --build`.
4.  **Initialize Database**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app sh
    # Inside container:
    apk add --no-cache postgresql-client
    psql -h db -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db -f src/db/db-init.sql
    psql -h db -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db -f add_top_level_organization.sql
    node add-test-data.js
    exit
    ```
5.  **Access**: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## 4. Initial System Configuration

After installation, perform these initial setup steps via the application's UI:

1.  **Log In**: Use the default administrator credentials (if any) or create the first user directly in the database.
2.  **Organization Settings**: Navigate to `Settings > Organization` and configure your organization's name, address, and financial settings.
3.  **Fiscal Years**: Navigate to `Settings > Fiscal Years` to define your fiscal periods.
4.  **Chart of Accounts**: Navigate to `Chart of Accounts` and either import your CoA from AccuFund or configure it manually.
5.  **Funds**: Navigate to `Funds` and set up your fund structure.

---

## 5. Database Administration

*   **Read-Only User for BI Tools**: It is highly recommended to create a separate, read-only user for connecting third-party BI tools like Metabase or Tableau.
    ```sql
    -- Connect to psql as the postgres user
    CREATE ROLE readonly_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE fund_accounting_db TO readonly_user;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly_user;
    ```
*   **Manual Migrations**: If a future update requires a database schema change, a migration script (`.sql` file) will be provided. Run it using `psql`. Always back up the database first.

---

## 6. User Management

User management is handled within the application UI:
*   **Location**: `Settings > Users`
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Add User**: Click "Add User" and fill in the details.
    *   **Edit User**: Click the "Edit" button next to a user to change their name, email, or role.
    *   **Deactivate User**: Edit the user and change their status to "Inactive".

---

## 7. Entity and Fund Hierarchy Administration

The organizational structure is critical for proper reporting.
*   **Reference**: `docs/HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` provides a deep dive into the architecture.
*   **Management**: Handled in `Settings > Entities`.
*   **Key Principles**:
    *   There should be **one** top-level entity with `is_consolidated = true`.
    *   Child entities should correctly point to their parent.
    *   Funds are always associated with a single entity.
    *   Use the "All Entities" filter on the Funds and Journal Entries pages to manage items before deleting an entity.

### 7.4 Inter-Entity Transfer Configuration

The **Inter-Entity Transfer** feature (introduced in v8.6) allows you to move cash between sibling entities while automatically creating a balanced pair of journal entries and maintaining accurate **Due To / Due From** balances.

#### 1. Purpose
*  Eliminate manual dual-entry work when one legal entity advances or reimburses funds to another.  
*  Preserve an auditable trail by linking the two journal entries with a shared **`matching_transaction_id`**.

#### 2. Required Account Types
Each entity that will participate in transfers must have:

| Account Type | Typical Code Range | Example Name            |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Asset**    | 19-xxxx           | “Due From \<Other Entity\>” |
| **Liability**| 29-xxxx           | “Due To \<Other Entity\>”   |

These accounts should be **Active** and mapped to the correct entity.

#### 3. Setup Checklist
1. Navigate to **Chart of Accounts → Add Account**.  
2. Select the **Entity** field so the account belongs to the right legal entity.  
3. Choose **Type = Asset** (for “Due From”) or **Liability** (for “Due To”).  
4. Use consistent codes (e.g., `1901`, `2901`) so the dropdown filters in the wizard recognise them.  
5. Repeat for every pair of entities that may transact.

#### 4. Best Practices
* Create one dedicated Due To / Due From account **per counter-party** instead of a single pooled account.  
* Agree on a naming convention (e.g., “Due From – TPF” / “Due To – TPF-ES”) to make reconciliation easier.  
* Post transfers **as-of the actual cash movement date** to keep books aligned with bank activity.  
* Review the **Inter-Entity Transfers** list (Reports → Inter-Entity) monthly to ensure all pairs are present and balanced.

#### 5. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| “No Due From accounts found” in wizard | Asset account not matching filter (name lacks “Due From” or code not `19…`) | Edit or create the correct account and retry. |
| Transfer posts but entity balances don’t match | One of the journal entries was edited or deleted | Use the **matching_transaction_id** to locate both entries, correct or repost. |
| Wizard hangs on submission | Database constraint failure (missing fund/account ID) | Check server logs; ensure all selected IDs exist and are active. |

## 8. NACHA Vendor Payment System Administration

### 8.1 Overview
Version 8.9 introduces a fully-integrated NACHA (ACH) **Vendor Payment System** that lets your organization pay suppliers electronically and generate bank-ready ACH files.  The feature set includes:
* Vendor master records with multiple bank accounts  
* Company-wide NACHA settings (Originating DFI, Company ID, SEC code)  
* Payment batch workflow (draft → approved → processed)  
* Automatic trace-number generation and **961-byte** ACH file creation  
* Secure file storage and download tracking  

### 8.2 Database Schema Additions
The following tables were added (see `nacha-vendor-payments-schema.sql`):

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `vendors` | Stores supplier / contractor master data |
| `vendor_bank_accounts` | ACH routing & account info (supports multiple per vendor) |
| `company_nacha_settings` | One record per legal entity containing ACH parameters |
| `payment_batches` | Container for one or more vendor payments |
| `payment_items` | Individual payment lines linked to a batch & vendor |
| `nacha_files` | Metadata for each generated ACH file |

All tables include audit columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, etc.) and appropriate foreign-key constraints.

### 8.3 Initial Setup
1. **Company NACHA Settings**  
   Navigate to **Settings → NACHA** and create a record for each entity that will originate ACH files.  Required fields:  
   * Originating DFI (8-digit routing)  
   * Immediate Destination (bank routing)  
   * Company ID (Tax ID)  
   * SEC Code (`CCD` or `PPD`)  
2. **Vendors & Bank Accounts**  
   * Go to **Vendors** → *Add Vendor*. Complete address & tax fields.  
   * Add at least one bank account. Routing numbers are validated via ABA checksum; account numbers are masked after save.  
3. **User Permissions**  
   Only users with the **Finance Manager** or **Administrator** role can approve batches or generate ACH files.  Assign roles under **Settings → Users**.

### 8.4 Payment Batch Workflow
1. **Create Batch** → *draft* status.  
2. **Add Payment Items** (amount > 0, memo & invoice refs optional).  
3. **Approve** → moves to *approved*; locks items from further edits.  
4. **Generate NACHA File** → status changes to *processed*; `trace_number` field on each item is populated automatically.  
5. **Transmit to Bank** – download the `.txt` file from **Files → Download** and upload via your bank portal.  Mark *transmitted* in the UI for audit completeness.

### 8.5 File Storage & Download
* Files are stored under `<project>/nacha-files/` (ignored by Git).  
* Download endpoint: `GET /api/nacha-files/:id/download` returns the file with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.  
* The table `nacha_files` tracks created & transmitted timestamps, batch linkage, and  **file_control_total** for quick reconciliation.

### 8.6 Security Considerations
* **Least-Privilege Access** – restrict NACHA screens to finance staff.  
* **File Permissions** – the `nacha-files/` directory is `chmod 700` and owned by the app user.  
* **Data at Rest** – Account numbers are stored encrypted or truncated (last 4 digits visible).  
* **Transport Security** – Always access the server over HTTPS; never email NACHA files.  
* **Audit Trail** – All CRUD actions on vendors, batches, and files are logged with user IDs.

### 8.7 Monitoring & Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Batch stuck in *approved* | Trace-number generation error | Check server logs; ensure `company_nacha_settings` exists |
| “Routing number invalid” | Fails ABA checksum | Verify 9-digit routing with vendor |
| File control total mismatch | Manual edit of file | Regenerate file; do **not** edit ACH files manually |
| Download 404 | File deleted or wrong ID | Verify `nacha_files.path`; regenerate if needed |

## 9. Backup and Recovery Procedures

### 8.1. Backup
Automated backup scripts are included in the `scripts/` directory.

*   **Linux**: Schedule `scripts/update-linux.sh` to run daily via `cron`. It automatically creates backups before updating. For manual backups:
    ```bash
    pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost fund_accounting_db > backup.sql
    ```
*   **Docker**: Schedule `scripts/update-docker-windows.ps1` to run daily. For manual backups:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec -T db pg_dump -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db > backup.sql
    ```

### 8.2. Recovery
In case of failure, use the backups to restore the system.

*   **Linux**:
    1.  Stop the application: `sudo systemctl stop npfa`.
    2.  Restore the database: `sudo -u postgres psql -d fund_accounting_db -f /path/to/backup.sql`.
    3.  Restore application files if needed from the `.tar.gz` backup.
    4.  Start the application: `sudo systemctl start npfa`.
*   **Docker**:
    1.  Stop the containers: `docker-compose down`.
    2.  Restore the database: `cat /path/to/backup.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d fund_accounting_db`.
    3.  Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d`.

---

## 9. System Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Checking Service Status**:
    *   **Linux**: `sudo systemctl status npfa.service`
    *   **Docker**: `docker-compose ps`
*   **Viewing Logs**:
    *   **Linux**: `sudo journalctl -u npfa -f` (live logs)
    *   **Docker**: `docker-compose logs -f app` (live logs)
*   **Log Rotation**: Ensure `logrotate` is configured for Nginx and the application logs to prevent disk space issues.
*   **Database Maintenance**: Periodically run `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` on the PostgreSQL database to maintain performance.

---

## 10. Security Considerations

*   **Firewall**: Use `ufw` on Linux to allow only necessary ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
*   **SSL/HTTPS**: Always deploy with an SSL certificate. Use Certbot with Nginx for free, auto-renewing certificates.
*   **Database Security**:
    *   Use a strong, unique password for the `postgres` user.
    *   Configure `pg_hba.conf` to only allow connections from trusted hosts.
    *   Use the dedicated read-only user for external BI tools.
*   **Application Security**:
    *   Run the Node.js process as a non-root user (`npfa`).
    *   Keep Node.js and npm packages updated (`npm audit`).
*   **SSH Security**: Disable password authentication and use SSH keys for server access.

---

## 11. Performance Tuning

*   **Database**: Ensure PostgreSQL has adequate `shared_buffers` and `work_mem` configured in `postgresql.conf` based on server RAM.
*   **Nginx**: Enable gzip compression and caching for static assets in your Nginx site configuration.
*   **Node.js**: For high-traffic environments, use a process manager like `pm2` to run the Node.js application in cluster mode, leveraging all CPU cores.

---

## 12. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **502 Bad Gateway** | The Node.js application (`npfa.service` or `app` container) is not running or has crashed. | 1. Check the application logs for errors (`journalctl` or `docker-compose logs`). <br> 2. Ensure the database is running. <br> 3. Restart the application service. |
| **"DB Offline"** | The Node.js application cannot connect to the PostgreSQL database. | 1. Verify PostgreSQL is running. <br> 2. Check the `.env` file for correct database credentials (host, user, password, dbname). <br> 3. Ensure network connectivity between the app and DB servers (or containers). |
| **404 Not Found on API routes** | Nginx is not proxying requests correctly, or the Node.js routes are not registered. | 1. Ensure the API routes are defined *before* the `app.use(express.static(...))` line in `server.js`. <br> 2. Check the Nginx configuration for a correct `proxy_pass` directive. |
| **Permission Denied errors** | File system permissions are incorrect. | Ensure the `npfa` user owns the application directory: `sudo chown -R npfa:npfa /home/npfa/nonprofit-fund-accounting`. |

---

## 13. Update and Upgrade Procedures

The repository includes automated update scripts in the `scripts/` directory. **It is highly recommended to use these scripts for all updates.**

*   **Linux**: `scripts/update-linux.sh`
*   **Docker on Windows**: `scripts/update-docker-windows.ps1`

These scripts automatically handle backups, code pulling, dependency updates, service restarts, and verification. Refer to the comments within the scripts for detailed information.

---

## 14. Integration Management

*   **Natural Language Query (NLQ)**: The NLQ engine relies on pattern matching defined in `natural-language-queries.html`. To add new query types, new patterns must be added to the `NLQ_PATTERNS` object in that file.
*   **Custom Reports Builder**: This feature uses a secure `REPORT_BUILDER_FIELD_MAP` in `server.js` to whitelist accessible tables and fields. To expose new data sources or fields to the report builder, they must be added to this map.
*   **BI Tools**: Connect using the dedicated read-only database user. The BI tool will have direct access to all tables and can build reports on the same data as the main application.

---

## 15. Best Practices for Production

1.  **Automate Backups**: Ensure the backup script is running daily via `cron` or Windows Task Scheduler.
2.  **Separate Environments**: Maintain separate development, staging, and production environments. Test all updates in staging before deploying to production.
3.  **Use Version Control**: All changes, including configuration, should be committed to Git. Use feature branches for development and merge to the main production branch (`v8.5` in our case) for deployment.
4.  **Monitor Actively**: Use tools like `htop` for real-time monitoring and set up alerts for service failures or high resource usage.
5.  **Secure Credentials**: Never commit secrets (like passwords or API keys) directly to Git. Use environment files (`.env`) and add them to `.gitignore`.

This guide provides the foundation for successfully administering the Non-Profit Fund Accounting System. For further technical details, refer to the other documentation files in the repository.
