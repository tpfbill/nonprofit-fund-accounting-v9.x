-- Description:
-- This script forcefully removes the "Main Organization" entity and ALL its
-- dependencies (funds, accounts, journal entries) since they're not part of 
-- the TPF hierarchy. This is a comprehensive cleanup to ensure a clean TPF-only
-- hierarchy.
--
-- WARNING: This script will DELETE data. Use with caution.
