Strategy: AccuFund to Custom Fund Accounting System</h1>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Migrating from an established system like AccuFund to a custom-built
solution requires careful planning. This document outlines a
comprehensive approach to ensure a successful transition.</p>
</div>
<section id="data-migration-strategy" class="section-content">
<h2>1. Data Migration Strategy</h2>
<h3 id="assessment-and-extraction">Assessment and Extraction:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Export all financial data from AccuFund (charts of accounts, funds,
transactions, budgets)</li>
<li>Extract vendor/customer information, recurring transactions, and
historical records</li>
<li>Document custom reports and specialized configurations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-transformation">Data Transformation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Map AccuFund chart of accounts structure to new system</li>
<li>Transform fund definitions and attributes</li>
<li>Convert historical journal entries while maintaining audit
trails</li>
<li>Adapt budget structures to the new database schema</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-validation">Data Validation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run parallel financial reports in both systems to verify
accuracy</li>
<li>Implement cross-checking reconciliation processes</li>
<li>Verify opening balances match closing balances from AccuFund</li>
</ul>

<section id="technical-implementation" class="section-content">
<h2>2. Technical Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="database-setup">Database Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement the PostgreSQL schema we designed</li>
<li>Create import utilities for AccuFund data</li>
<li>Build data verification and integrity checks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integration-requirements">Integration Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify any third-party systems AccuFund interfaces with (banking,
payroll, etc.)</li>
<li>Develop equivalent integration points in the new system</li>
<li>Test data flow between systems</li>
</ul>

<section id="inter-entity-transfer-configuration-v8.8"
class="section-content">
<h2>2.5 Inter-Entity Transfer Configuration (v8.8+)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Inter-Entity Transfer</strong> feature, introduced in
version 8.8 of the Fund Accounting System, automates cash movements
between related legal entities by creating paired
<em>Due To</em>/<em>Due From</em> journal entries. When migrating from
AccuFund you must ensure the underlying account structure and historical
transactions correctly map to this new capability.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters-for-multi-entity-organizations">Why It Matters
for Multi-Entity Organizations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eliminates manual dual-entry work between entities.</li>
<li>Provides an auditable <code>matching_transaction_id</code> that
links both sides of the transfer.</li>
<li>Keeps inter-company balances in sync via <em>Due To</em>/<em>Due
From</em> accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="required-due-to-due-from-account-structure">Required <em>Due To
/ Due From</em> Account Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assets 19xx – “Due From &lt;Other Entity&gt;”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Liabilities 29xx – “Due To &lt;Other
Entity&gt;”</strong></li>
<li>Create one pair per counter-party entity to simplify
reconciliation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mapping-accufund-accounts-to-the-new-system">Mapping AccuFund
Accounts to the New System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Locate AccuFund GL accounts used for inter-company settlements.</li>
<li>Map each to the correct 19xx / 29xx account code in the new chart of
accounts (or create new accounts if missing).</li>
<li>Confirm each account is assigned to the correct entity in the import
CSV.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="migration-considerations-for-existing-inter-entity-transactions">Migration
Considerations for Existing Inter-Entity Transactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>When importing historical journal entries, populate
<code>is_inter_entity</code>, <code>target_entity_id</code> and
<code>matching_transaction_id</code> so legacy transfers appear as
linked pairs.</li>
<li>If AccuFund stored transfers as single multi-line entries, split
them into two separate entries (one per entity) during
transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="validation-steps-post-migration">Validation Steps
Post-Migration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run the “Inter-Entity Transfers” report and verify all historic
transfers appear in matched pairs.</li>
<li>Confirm each entity’s <em>Due To</em> balance equals the
counter-party’s <em>Due From</em> balance.</li>
<li>Perform a sample transfer in the new system to ensure automatic
dual-entry posting functions as expected.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================ NEW SECTION 2.6 ============================ -->
<section id="bank-account-integration-v8.7" class="section-content">
<h2>2.6 Bank Account Integration (v8.7+)</h2>

<p>The <strong>Bank Account Management</strong> module—added in version 8.7
and enhanced in v8.8—allows direct tracking and optional online
connections to operating, savings, and credit-card accounts.  When
migrating from AccuFund you should map every active AccuFund bank account
to an equivalent record in the new system to preserve beginning
balances, reconciliation history, and account metadata.</p>

<h3 id="identify-accufund-bank-accounts">Identifying Bank Accounts in AccuFund</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Run the <em>Bank Accounts Listing</em> report (Administration → Banking).</li>
  <li>Export the report to CSV, capturing: Bank Name, Account Name,
      GL Account Code, Routing Number, Last Reconciled Date, and
      Current Balance.</li>
  <li>Note any accounts marked <em>Inactive</em>—these can be imported with
      <code>status = "Inactive"</code> so history is preserved but the
      account is hidden from daily workflows.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="map-bank-data">Mapping Bank Account Data to the New System</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare CSV</strong> – Create <code>bank_accounts.csv</code>
      with the following columns:<br>
      <code>bank_name,account_name,account_number,routing_number,type,status,balance,connection_method,description</code></li>
  <li><strong>Type Mapping</strong> – AccuFund “Checking” → “Checking”,
      “Savings” → “Savings”, “Credit Card” → “Credit Card”.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection Method</strong> – Use <code>Manual</code> for all
      imports; you can switch to <code>Plaid</code> or <code>OFX</code>
      later once online credentials are verified.</li>
  <li><strong>Opening Balance</strong> – Populate the
      <code>balance</code> field with the CSV export’s <em>Current
      Balance</em> as of the migration cut-over date.</li>
  <li><strong>Import</strong> – Upload the CSV via
      <em>Settings → Data Import → Bank Accounts</em> and validate.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bank-best-practices">Best Practices for Setting Up Bank Accounts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear Naming</strong> – Include the entity or fund in the
      <em>Account Name</em> (e.g., “TPF – Operating Checking”).</li>
  <li><strong>One-to-One Mapping</strong> – Ensure each GL cash account
      points to exactly one bank-account record to simplify
      reconciliation.</li>
  <li><strong>Reconcile Immediately</strong> – After import, run the
      Reconciliation Wizard for the last closed period to confirm the
      opening balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable Online Sync Later</strong> – Wait until after
      cut-over and internal verification before turning on Plaid/OFX to
      avoid duplicate transactions.</li>
</ul>

training</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reporting-differences">Reporting Differences:</h3>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="cost-considerations" class="section-content">
<h2>6. Cost Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development costs for migration utilities</li>
<li>Staff time for data validation and testing</li>
<li>Potential consulting assistance for complex data mapping</li>
<li>Training and documentation development</li>
</ul>
<p>A successful migration would typically take 4-6 months from planning
to full implementation, depending on the complexity of your AccuFund
implementation and the amount of historical data to be migrated.</p>
