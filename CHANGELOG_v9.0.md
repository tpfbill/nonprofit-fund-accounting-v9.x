## üóÇÔ∏è New Directory Map

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `database/` | Schema, migration & seed scripts (`db-init.sql`, `setup-database-cross-platform.sql`, `load-principle-foundation-data.js`, etc.) |
| `debug/` | One-off debug and hot-fix scripts, experimental HTML/JS test beds. |
| `tests/` | Automated and manual test pages (`test-batches.html`, `api-tester.html`, etc.). |
| `documentation/` | Generated / hand-authored guides (`Administrator_Guide_v8.8.html`, AccuFund migration docs‚Ä¶). |
| `src/` | Application source (CSS, JS modules, DB helpers). |
| `archive/` | PDFs and legacy artefacts kept for historical reference. |
| *Root* | Core application entry points (`index.html`, `server.js`, `vendor-payments.html`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `nacha-generator.js`). |
